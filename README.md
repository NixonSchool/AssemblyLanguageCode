**🔧 My World of Assembly Language 🔧**

I know you're ready to dive headfirst into the wild and wonderful world of **assembly programming**. 

I've documented my own assembly quest, from fumbling beginner to... well, slightly less fumbling enthusiast.

**⏱️ Pace Yourself**

Remember, this isn't a sprint. Assembly is like learning to speak machine – it takes **time, REPETITION, REPETITION and patience**. 

When you're stuck (and trust me, you will be), we have our AI friends ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.

For better notes, use cherrytree to open the .ctd files:

Change some preferences, and you'll have a similar looking cherrytree theme.

**🕵️ Why Bother?**

To do a reverse engineer's job, malware analysis, pentesting and use tools like ghidra, ida, cutter, binary ninja, radare and the rest, that's where assembly shines. 

Plus, it's a great way to impress (or terrify) your programming buddies and your crush obviously.

I want you to be able to fine-tune any complex machine. 

It's not easy, but with time you get the flow and be able to integrate it into your C/C++ programs.

You will be slapped by errors every single point, don't quit.

Also, many IDEs do not support assembly directly, so...

You'll learn to carry out research on the tools you need, go in yourself, download libaries, set them up manually and run them in your terminal or IDE. 

You are the compiler, you get the dependencies and set them up. 

Remember, I'm learning too! This is my attempt to make assembly a bit less scary for all of us curious coders out there.

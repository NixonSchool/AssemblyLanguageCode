These examples are designed for emu8086 assembler and microprocessor emulator.

You can do practice on them , try converting them to masm equivalents and running them. 

You can run the programs from visual studio community/pro/enterprise after making the adjustments.

Masm is also within this folder. You can also get it from their official website or use visual studio.

Thank you!
